            8/21/23 - 8/24/23 Week1 <br>
            This week in Engineering I learned about saftey.<br>
            I learned to always wear saftey glasses and don't wear loose<br>
            clothing. I learned about OSHA and how it is the Satey organization<br> 
            for engineering. I learned how to use AWS and how to code for it.<br>
            Finally, I learned about Github and how to make it work.<br>
