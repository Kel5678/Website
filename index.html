            8/21/23 - 8/24/23 Week1 <br>
            This week in Engineering I learned about saftey.<br>
            I learned to always wear saftey glasses and don't wear loose<br>
            clothing. I learned about OSHA and how it is the Satey organization<br> 
            for engineering. I learned how to use AWS and how to code for it.<br>
            Finally, I learned about Github and how to make it work.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            8/21/23 - Week 2
        </p>This week in Engeneering I learned how to keep myself
        safe. I also learned how to use Tinkercad. I made a basketball 
        court for my project. My groupmates and I created our project 
        to scale. I learned how to use Tinkercad well. 
        
            9/05/23 9/08/23 Week 3
            <p> This week in Engineering I learned how to build 
            my project. We began building and cutting the cardboard. 
            We overcame some problems. We also used our drawing
            of our project. We used it to help us build. </p>

<p> Week 4 (9/11-9/15)</p>
<p> This week in engineering I finished my project. My team and I
overcame challenges together. We were able to pop the balloon. 
Our project was a success. I also learned how important planning
ahead is. Before starting our project we planned it. It was
a fun experience. I also learned how important accuate dimensions are. </p>

     <p> Week 5(9/18-9/22)</p>
     <p> This week in engeneering we talked about computer sceince.
     We also did challenges. We did two challenges, a boat flotation
     device and the letter "E". I enjoyed the boat floatation 
     challenge more. It was a fun experience and I was interested
     to see how long my boat could float for. The paper "E" 
     challenge was fun too. I was able to successfully draw and cut
     out another persons E. </p>

 <p> Week 6 (9/25-9/29)</p>
 <p> This week in engineering I learned about computer parts</p>
 <p> My partner and I picked a computer apart. We opened it</p>
 <p> and saw the cool parts. We put the parts out then put</p>
 <p> them back in. It worked so we did it correctly. I also</p>
 <p> did a worksheet where I colored the parts of a computer.</p>
 <p> Overall, this week I learned a lot about computers.</p>

     <p> Week 7 (10/2-10/6)</p>
     <p> This week in engineering I learned about bio engineering.</p>
     <P> I learned about prosthetics and even made my own. I </P>
     <p> made my own prosthetic arm using cardboard. There were</p>
     <p> multiple difficulties such as the fingers not grabbing</p>
     <p> the water bottle. We had to make it as good as we could.</p>
     <p>I also made a prosthetic on tinkercad for a dog's leg.</p>
     <p> I researched how the prosthetic needs to connect to the dog.</p>

    <p> Week 8 (10/9-10/13)</p>
    <p> This week in engineering I learned about Aerospace
    <p> Engineering. I learned about the different types of it.</p>
    <p>I also designed a rocket on Tinkercad. I was stuck at first</p>
    <p>and didn't know how to begin. After thinking deeply about it,</p>
    <p>I was able to figure out a design. My group combined all of </p>
    <p>our designs together.</p>

    <p> Week 9 (10/16-10/20) </p>
    <p> This week in engineering I learned a lot. I learned </p>
    <p> more about aerospace engineering and how it has much to do</p>
    <p> with space. The topic interests me and I find how it works cool. </p>
    <p> Our test project went well since we took time with it.  </p>
    <p>  We didn't use that much water which was a mistake.  </p>
    <p> If we could do it again we would've used more </p>
    <p>water.</p>

    <p>Week 10 (10/23-10/27)</p>
    <p> This week in Engineering I learned about environmental</p>
    <p> engineering. The water clearing project was fun. We </p>
    <p> were able to make the water pretty clear by taking time on it.We used the </p>
    <p> materials in a good order. We also had the water go through </p>
    <p> multiple times. That was very helpful with making the water</p>
    <p> as clear as possible.</p>

    <p> Week 11 (10/30-11/3)</p>
    <p>This week in Engineering I learned about many things.</p>
    <p>I learned about Ohm's law. At first it was confusing </p>
    <p> but eventually got easier. The formulas I needed being</p>
    <p> on the worksheet helped a lot. The Ohm's law equation is </p>
    <p> V=IR. I learned that electrical engineering is any form </p>
    <p> of engineering involed with the study, designing, and use </p>
    <p>of appliances and equipment which use any form of electricity.</p>
    <p>I also had hands on experience with electricity.</p>

    <p> Week 12 (11/6-11/10)</p>
    <p> This week in Engeneering I had fun and did hands on activites. </p>
    <p>I did 2 labs this week with my group. For me, the labs were difficult </p>
    <p>at first. My parter helped me figure it out and I was able to finish it.</p>
    <p>I learned a lot during the circit multimeter challege, especially about  </p>
    <p> math. I had done those equations in the past so that experience helped me.</p>
    <p> I prefer doing more hands on activites like we did since it helps me learn</p>\
    <p> the easiest.</p>

    <p> Week 13 (11/13-11/17)</p>
    <p>This week in Engeneering I learned much about business engeneering. So far, </p>
    <p> I have found the most intrest in this type of engineering. For my group's </p>
    <p>Shark Tank project, we decided on making recyclrates. Recylarates are a </p>
    <p>ball filled with nutrients. We came up with other ideas aswell but this </p>
    <p>was the best one in our opinion. Recyclates would be very helpful for </p>
    <p>poorer places. They arent expensive and can be a full meal.</p>

    <p>Week 14 (11/27-12/1)</p>
    <p>During this week, I researched information about our pitch. We searched </p>
    <p>many topics, such as, price, profit, and other possible problems. </p>
    <p>FOr the price, we had worries for if it would be too expensive. We found </p>
    <p>out if we used cheeper materials it would work out with us making a good </p>
    <p>profit. But, so we could make profit, we had to make the price higher than </p>
    <p>what it costs us to make the Recyclates. Our group had these conversations</p>
    <p> and although we went through some disagreements, we found out agreements.</p>
    <p>My favorite pitch was Nazeli's miracle maskera because of how unique it was.</p>

    <p>Week 15 (12/4-12/8)</p>
    <li>1. The bridge that me, Naz, and Liam worked on was 57.4 grams. The bridge Dominic worked on was 46.7 grams.</li>
    <2i>2. The bridge me, Naz, and Liam worked on held a water weight of 675 grams. The other bridge held 1241 grams.</2i>
    <3i>3. Our bridge that weighed 57.4g could carry 11.8g of water for ever gram of weight. The 46.7g bridge could carry 26.6g of water per 1g of weight. </3i>
    
    <p>I am reffering to the bridge I worked on, 57.4g, for the next questions. </p>
    <4i>4. The parts that contributed to the bulk of the weight in our bridge were 2 points that were near the center. We trippled the layering of pasta there.</4i
    <4i>We did it to keep the weight from the string from the bucket. </4i>
    <5i>5. The insperation for our design came from our imaginations. I wanted it to be reliable.</5i>
    <6i>6.The design didn't work as we intended it to. It lacked support and layering.</6i>
    <7i>7.The point of failure in our bridge was it's lack of thickness and streamlined design. If we could change just one of those, we would be</7i>
    <7i>able to add another cup of water.</7i>
    <8i>A big way to improve and fix our bridge is to add arches/some type of vertical support. We should've crossed the spagetti so it wouldn't break.</8i>

    <p>Semester 2</p>
    <p>Week 1 1/8-1/12</p>
    <p>From the chemical engineering slides, I learned chemical engeneering has </p>
    <p>a variety of feilds, such as, oil exploration, Nanotechnology, and Metallurgy.</p>
    <p>I learned Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a near-atomic scale.</p>
    <p>I also learned oil exploration is a search for petroleum. From the Oobleck </p>
    <p>project, I learned you shouldn't add too much water. That was the most important</p>
    <p>part, as we put too much and it became too liquidy. The cornstarch and water</p>water
    <p>mixed pretty well overall. The project was fun and a good learning experience.</p>

    <p>Semester 2</p>
    <p> Week 2 1/15-1/19</p>
    <p>In engineering this week for our project we researched a lot about potential</p>
    <p>ideas, designs,techniques, and more. For our design, we are thinking about</p>
    <p>using four small CDs for the wheels. Our research led us to learning smaller </p>
    <p>wheels are faster. We are going to ues the cardboard as our base since that </p>
    <p>would be the smartest use for it. From the mosuetrap video, I got many ideas </p>
    <p>that we could use for our car. We researched more about other people making</p>
    <p>mouse trap cars. We used that information to learn from errors other people made.</p>
