            This week in Engineering I learned about saftey.<br>
            I learned to always wear saftey glasses and don't wear loose<br>
            clothing. I learned about OSHA and how it is the Satey organization<br> 
            for engineering. I learned how to use AWS and how to code for it.<br>
            Finally, I learned about Github and how to make it work.<br>

        </p>This week in Engeneering I learned how to keep myself
        safe. I also learned how to use Tinkercad. I made a basketball 
        court for my project. My groupmates and I created our project 
        to scale. I learned how to use Tinkercad well.

            <p> This week in Engineering I learned how to build 
            my project. We began building and cutting the cardboard. 
            We overcame some problems. We also used our drawing
            of our project. We used it to help us build. </p>

<p> This week in engineering I finished my project. My team and I
overcame challenges together. We were able to pop the balloon. 
Our project was a success. I also learned how important planning
ahead is. Before starting our project we planned it. It was
a fun experience. I also learned how important accuate dimensions are. </p>

     <p> This week in engeneering we talked about computer sceince.
     We also did challenges. We did two challenges, a boat flotation
     device and the letter "E". I enjoyed the boat floatation 
     challenge more. It was a fun experience and I was interested
     to see how long my boat could float for. The paper "E" 
     challenge was fun too. I was able to successfully draw and cut
     out another persons E. </p>
