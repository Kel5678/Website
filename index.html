            8/21/23 - 8/24/23 Week1 <br>
            This week in Engineering I learned about saftey.<br>
            I learned to always wear saftey glasses and don't wear loose<br>
            clothing. I learned about OSHA and how it is the Satey organization<br> 
            for engineering. I learned how to use AWS and how to code for it.<br>
            Finally, I learned about Github and how to make it work.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            8/21/23 - Week 2
        </p>This week in Engeneering I learned how to keep myself
        safe. I also learned how to use Tinkercad. I made a basketball 
        court for my project. My groupmates and I created our project 
        to scale. I learned how to use Tinkercad well. 
        
            9/05/23 9/08/23 Week 3
            <p> This week in Engineering I learned how to build 
            my project. We began building and cutting the cardboard. 
            We overcame some problems. We also used our drawing
            of our project. We used it to help us build. </p>

<p> Week 4 (9/11-9/15)</p>
<p> This week in engineering I finished my project. My team and I
overcame challenges together. We were able to pop the balloon. 
Our project was a success. I also learned how important planning
ahead is. Before starting our project we planned it. It was
a fun experience. I also learned how important accuate dimensions are. </p>

     <p> Week 5(9/18-9/22)</p>
     <p> This week in engeneering we talked about computer sceince.
     We also did challenges. We did two challenges, a boat flotation
     device and the letter "E". I enjoyed the boat floatation 
     challenge more. It was a fun experience and I was interested
     to see how long my boat could float for. The paper "E" 
     challenge was fun too. I was able to successfully draw and cut
     out another persons E. </p>

 <p> Week 6 (9/25-9/29)</p>
 <p> This week in engineering I learned about computer parts</p>
 <p> My partner and I picked a computer apart. We opened it</p>
 <p> and saw the cool parts. We put the parts out then put</p>
 <p> them back in. It worked so we did it correctly. I also</p>
 <p> did a worksheet where I colored the parts of a computer.</p>
 <p> Overall, this week I learned a lot about computers.</p>

     <p> Week 7 (10/2-10/6)</p>
     <p> This week in engineering I learned about bio engineering.</p>
     <P> I learned about prosthetics and even made my own. I </P>
     <p> made my own prosthetic arm using cardboard. There were</p>
     <p> multiple difficulties such as the fingers not grabbing</p>
     <p> the water bottle. We had to make it as good as we could.</p>
     <p>I also made a prosthetic on tinkercad for a dog's leg.</p>
     <p> I researched how the prosthetic needs to connect to the dog.</p>

    <p> Week 8 (10/9-10/13)</p>
    <p> This week in engineering I learned about Aerospace
    <p> Engineering. I learned about the different types of it.</p>
    <p>I also designed a rocket on Tinkercad. I was stuck at first</p>
    <p>and didn't know how to begin. After thinking deeply about it,</p>
    <p>I was able to figure out a design. My group combined all of </p>
    <p>our designs together.</p>

    <p> Week 9 (10/16-10/20) </p>
    <p> This week in engineering I learned a lot. I learned </p>
    <p> more about aerospace engineering. It has much to do </p>
    <p> with space. Our test project went well. We took time </p>
    <p> with our design and it paied off. We didn't use that </p>
    <p> much water. If we could do it again we would've used more </p>
    <p>water.</p>

    <p>Week 10 (10/23-10/27)</p>
    <p> This week in Engineering I learned about environmental</p>
    <p> engineering. The water clearing project was fun. We </p>
    <p> were able to make the water pretty clear. We used the </p>
    <p> materials in a good order. We also had the water go through </p>
    <p> multiple times. That was very helpful with making the water</p>
    <p> as clear as possible.</p>
